Valentine's Day NLP Matching Algorithm

Built using Google's BERT sentence encoding, with bert-as-service. Pairwise matches all users by most similar answers, then provides each user with top 3 picks (outside of gender disparity), making sure all matches are mutual.

To run, you will need to download one of the English BERT pretrained models from their site, and run the server locally (instructions on bert-as-service github).
